SMART CLASSROOM ENERGY OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM USING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS
Project Proposal
Project Title
Smart Classroom Energy Optimization System Using Predictive Analytics
1. Introduction
Energy conservation has become an important concern for educational institutions due to 
rising electricity costs and environmental impact. In colleges and universities, classrooms 
consume a significant amount of energy through lights, fans, and air conditioners. Often, 
these devices remain operational even when classrooms are partially occupied or 
completely vacant.
Most existing energy management solutions depend on manual monitoring or expensive 
IoT-based sensor systems. Manual control is inefficient, and hardware-based solutions are 
costly and difficult to maintain. Therefore, there is a need for a software-based, intelligent, 
and cost-effective system that can optimize classroom energy usage without relying on 
physical sensors.
This project proposes a Smart Classroom Energy Optimization System that uses class 
schedules, historical attendance data, and predictive analytics to estimate classroom 
occupancy and generate energy usage recommendations. The system helps 
administrators reduce energy wastage while maintaining a comfortable learning 
environment.
2. Problem Statement
Educational institutions experience significant energy wastage due to inefficient 
classroom energy usage. Electrical appliances remain switched on even when classrooms 
are underutilized or unused. There is no intelligent system that predicts classroom 
occupancy in advance and optimizes energy usage accordingly.
Manual supervision is unreliable and time-consuming, while IoT-based solutions require 
additional infrastructure and cost. Hence, a software-driven system that predicts 
occupancy and suggests energy optimization actions is required.
3. Proposed Solution
The proposed system analyzes: - Existing class timetables - Historical attendance records 
- Classroom capacity and subject type
Using this data, the system: 1. Predicts the probability of classroom occupancy 2. Applies 
rule-based logic to decide optimal energy usage 3. Generates energy usage 
recommendations 4. Produces energy consumption and savings reports
The system does not create class schedules or physically control devices. Instead, it acts 
as a decision-support system for administrators.
4. Objectives
1. To collect and organize classroom-related data, including class schedules, 
classroom capacity, subject type, and historical attendance records.
2. To preprocess and analyze the collected data by cleaning, formatting, and selecting 
relevant features required for occupancy prediction.
3. To design and implement a machine learning model that predicts classroom 
occupancy levels based on timetable and historical usage patterns.
4. To develop a rule-based energy optimization engine that generates energy usage 
recommendations using predicted occupancy levels.
5. To design and implement a backend system for managing classroom data, 
schedules, and prediction results.
6. To develop a user-friendly frontend interface for administrators to view occupancy 
predictions, energy recommendations, and reports.
7. To estimate classroom energy consumption and potential energy savings using 
predefined power usage parameters.
8. To evaluate the performance of the prediction model using appropriate metrics 
such as accuracy and consistency.
9. To integrate all system modules into a complete decision-support system for 
classroom energy optimization.
